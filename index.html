				    				<h1>Its the year 540...</h1><br><br>
				    				<p>Whilst investigating the death of a local swordsman, a surviving full stack developer called Luke Torrance uncovers a legend about a supernaturally-cursed, hawk circulating throughout Austin. As soon as anyone uses the hawk, he or she has exactly 55 days left to live.  At the end of the 55 days, the Red Witch will come to collect her price.</p>
				    				<p>The doomed few appear to be ordinary people during day to day life, but when photographed, they look grey. A marked person feels like a rural mouse to touch.</p>
				    				<p>Luke gets hold of the hawk, refusing to believe the superstition. A collage of images flash into his mind: a dirty gerbil balancing on a tattered swordsman, an old newspaper headline about a magic accident, a hooded frog ranting about eyes and a drinking well located in an urban place.</p>
				    				<p>When Luke notices his eyelashes have mouse-like properties, he realises that the curse of the magic hawk is true and calls in his lover, a fishmonger called Andrew Torrance, to help.</p>
				    				<p>Andrew examines the hawk and willingly submits himself to the curse. He finds that the same visions flash before his eyes. He finds the dirty gerbil balancing on a tattered swordsman particularly chilling. He joins the queue for a supernatural death.</p>
				    				<p>Luke and Andrew pursue a quest to uncover the meaning of the visions, starting with a search for the hooded frog. Will they be able to stop the curse before their time is up?</p>
				    				<br>
				    				<p>After 55 days of the curse, the Red Witch captures the afflicted</p><br><br>
				    				<p>Your time has come, and you have been captured</p><br><br>
				    				<p>The only escape is to guess the code word</p><br><br>
									<p>Type the letter you wish to guess, pray you are correct.</p><br><br>
				    				<p>If you aren't correct, one piece of you will be added to the noose.</p><br><br>
				    				<p>When your entire body is added to the noose...</p><br><br>
